# The Shooty Planes Archive

The no longer maintained source code for my first proper game, Shooty Planes, made in Godot 3. Yes it is disgusting, even more so than Blobs with Guns (my second game).

It's up here for purely archival purposes and not intended to be actively developed.

Note that the versioning is kinda scuffed because I'm using the original versioning system that I developed before I knew that semantic versioning was a thing. \*Sigh*
